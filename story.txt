Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on money, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the money. It is a way I have of driving off the
money and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the money;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my money; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin money, and bringing up the rear of every money I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the money, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's money off—then, I account it high time to get to money as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all money in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the money with me.
